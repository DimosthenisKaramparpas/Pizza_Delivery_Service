# Pizza_Delivery_Service
Pizza Delivery Service made in java using eclipse for a school project.
In this project, the user sets a number of orders and they are handled by 3 stores independently in different threads, one using FIFO, the other Random and the other based on the value of the pizza ordered (most expensive first).
